## National Parks explorer

[Demo](https://youtu.be/EB1DNREkMNY).

National Parks Explorer is a recreation of the National Parks Service Website. The application utilizes React and Redux for state management. The site is styled with Materialize and custom Css. The maps for each state are rendered with google maps and a GEOJSON polygon.

The app uses a [Rails API Backend](https://github.com/josephdlawson21/react-game-backend).
